## Anomaly Detection

The task is to design a software tool or app that supports production engineers in detecting anomalies in sensor measurement data from a production line. The final product should output a score that estimates the probability of an anomaly in the given data.

Emphasis is placed on the intuitive and user-friendly nature of the tool and the interpretability of the results. 

Two datasets containing time-series data (one continuous time-series per column) are provided for the development.
